The site [freecycle.org](https://www.freecycle.org/browse/US) is for people to exchange or give away stuff they don't need. 


the site [letgo](https://us.letgo.com/en) is for people to sell what they don't want for money. 

I feel that the freecycle.org site is too primative and raw, perhaps I can appropriate some features and design from [letgo](https://us.letgo.com/en) to combine with the core functionality of [freecycle.org](https://www.freecycle.org/browse/US) to create a new site called Givt. 


The basic features of the site Givt includes 

V 1.0 (within thinkful capstone scope)
* users signup, users login, admin login, users can upload items, leave comment on items and specify their location of exchange. 

V 2.0 (future scope outside thinkful capstone)
* interactive chat between users, reputation system, may include crypto currency reward system etc. 

V 3.0
 * organize local giver club events.
